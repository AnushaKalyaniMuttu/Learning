The com.gorylenko.gradle-git-properties plugin is a Gradle plugin that helps to integrate Git information into your project build process.
It is primarily used to add information about the Git repository (e.g., commit hash, branch name, tags, and other Git-related metadata) into the generated build artifacts, such as JARs or WARs.
