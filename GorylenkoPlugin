The apply plugin: 'build-audit' line in a Gradle build script is used to apply the Gradle Build Audit Plugin. This plugin helps you monitor and audit the quality, efficiency, 
and performance of your build by providing useful reports on various aspects of the build lifecycle.

What Does the build-audit Plugin Do?
The Build Audit Plugin is designed to provide insights into your Gradle build, including potential performance bottlenecks, and can help improve the overall efficiency of the build process. 
It generates reports that show how long each task takes, what dependencies are used, and how different parts of the build are executed.

Features of the build-audit Plugin
Performance Insights: It helps identify slow or redundant tasks by providing detailed information about task execution times.
Task Execution Reports: The plugin generates reports on the tasks executed during the build, including the time taken for each task.
Dependency Analysis: It helps to identify unused or redundant dependencies.
Configuration Audit: The plugin checks for potential misconfigurations and issues within the Gradle build script.
Improvement Recommendations: Based on the analysis, it can provide suggestions to optimize the build process.


How to Use build-audit Plugin
To use the Gradle Build Audit Plugin, you need to apply it in your build.gradle file and configure it if necessary.

1. Apply the Plugin
Add the plugin to your build.gradle file:

plugins {
    id 'build-audit' version '0.13.0'  // Ensure you're using the correct version of the plugin
}


2. Running the Plugin
Once the plugin is applied, you can run the following tasks to get various audit reports:

buildAudit: This task generates a summary report of the build audit, showing detailed information about the buildâ€™s performance, task execution times, and potential optimization opportunities.
./gradlew buildAudit


3. Sample Configuration
You might not need to configure the plugin much as it works out of the box, but in some cases, you might want to fine-tune it, for example,
 by configuring output directories for reports or excluding certain tasks from the audit.

buildAudit {
    outputDir = file("$buildDir/audit-reports")  // Specify where to save the audit reports
    includeBuildScan = true                     // Optionally include build scan information
    excludeTasks = ['compileJava', 'processResources']  // Optionally exclude specific tasks
}


Audit Results:

- Task Execution Time:
  - compileJava: 45.2s
  - processResources: 12.1s
  - build: 90.3s
  - test: 23.0s
  
- Recommendations:
  - Consider using parallel execution for tasks to reduce build time.
  - Optimize the `compileJava` task by caching intermediate outputs.
  - Reduce the number of dependencies declared in your build script.
