Class Components:
Class components were used in older versions of React, but functional components are now recommended for most cases (especially with the introduction of hooks).


import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Greeting extends Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
  }
}

export default Greeting;
---


import React from 'react';

function Greeting() {
  return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
}

export default Greeting;
